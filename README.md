An implementation of CycleGAN in Pytorch from the Aladdin Persson YouTube channel.

Note: I barely understood this project; it was not the best jumping off point for learning Pytorch.

To use the train.py file, you must download the data from kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suyashdamle/cyclegan](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suyashdamle/cyclegan)
